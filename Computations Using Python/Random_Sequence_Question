"""4. Create a Python program that does the following:
(a) Generates a dataset of 500 random numbers between 0 and 100.
(b) Calculate the following measures of dispersion:
 Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the
dataset.
 Standard Deviation: A measure of how spread out the values are."""
